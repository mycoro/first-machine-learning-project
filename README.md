This machine learning project is a simple project where you train the machine to be able to predict someone's music taste, especially the music genre, based on their gender and age. 
I started this project as I finished a python course on Youtube by @programmingwithmosh and I was curious concerning machine learning. It is the reason why I started learning
python. 
The data set concerning this project is from this link: http://bit.ly/music-csv
